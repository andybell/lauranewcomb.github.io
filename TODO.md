 DAB's notes:
 - [ ] Make header have a shadowed line to make it more clear that it is floating (it looks like there is a faint grey line? maybe just make it darker)
 - [ ] When clicking on "publications" or "links" these should come to the top of the page
 - [ ] Is there a reason why certain words are bolded in the research text?
 - [ ] Link through to her publications (like on Laura's University of W bio page)
 - [x] When I first clicked on the photos they took a long time to load. It was fine after they were cached. Perhaps size these down if they are large files (it might have something to do with github?)
 - [x] Generally all the links to outside sources open in the same tab. Its nice if they open in a separate tab, that way the focus is kept on Laura and not diverted by the external links
 - [x] The link to the dailyclimate.org news link may eventually expire. It might be wise to save this page as pdf to have a back up link. (A live link is better for SEO for the time being)
 - [x] Small note: When clicking on "Laura A. Newcomb" on the top left of the page, have the page limits return to original "home" screen (top of the purple banner, not the top of her photo)
 - [x] Make sure margins are the same throughout the whole length
 - [x] The text under each photo has a different justification.
 - [x] Rework this sentence to flow a little better " In the face of ocean warming and ocean acidification, these both are questions to answer in light of how organisms will live in a high CO2 world."
 - [x] The box next to her photo is a different size than her photo. I would maybe even get rid of the box around her name and contact info. Fix adjusted border to 1px.
 - [x] The first pic says "mussels" (plural) when there is only one mussel. I know what is intended, but maybe change phrasing slightly
 - [x] Bottom link to IGERT goes to google
 - [ ] Side Note FYI: her links on her IPOC profile are broken


Edits

- [x] standardize link circles on all pages
- [ ] margin between contact and profile differs when adjusting screen size
- [ ] make publications link to pdfs/researchgate etc?
