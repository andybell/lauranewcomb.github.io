Research

Marine organisms (animals and plants living in the ocean) along the coast experience large fluctations in the ocean conditions they live in. Temperature, as well as the amount of oxygen and pH, the aciditiy of the water, can vary both daily and over the course of a year.  I study how animals (with a particular interest in shellfish) perform under these varied conditions by measuring how the materials they make, like shells and skeletons can change with ocean conditions. In the face of ocean warming and ocean acidification, these become are questions to answer in light of how organisms will live in a high CO2 world.

As a graduate student, my work focuses on studying mussel attachment in light of elevated temperature and ocean acidification. I am particularly interestest in its effects on the mussel aquaculture industry, an industry that benefits from a mussel's strong attachment.
